# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


My website top 3 feature is---

- In my website have some donation card. Every donation card have a category. I am insure that every category have a dynamic color. That is user feel safe and I think user experience will be good.

- When user click any of donation card he/she will be go Donation Details Page. Here! They know about these particular donation card in details. And this donation details page include a Donate Button with amount. If user can donate then they do can it.

- If any user Donate they can see there donation history in Donation page. And they also can see pie chart about there donation base.
